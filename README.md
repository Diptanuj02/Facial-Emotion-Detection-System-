# Facial-Emotion-Detection-System
Facial Emotion Detection System Using Machine Learning-  Real-time facial emotion detection is an advanced computer vision application that allows for the recognition of human emotions through live video streams.
This project leverages two powerful tools: OpenCV, a widely-used library for real-time image processing, and Deep Face, a deep learning framework for facial analysis.
The DeepFace.analyze () function is called on the detected face, specifying ‘emotion’ as the key action to be performed. The result of this function is a detailed breakdown of the emotions detected, with one dominant emotion (such as happiness, sadness, anger, or surprise) identified from the face.
Here are the versions of libraries that I used- 
deepface                     0.0.93
numpy                        1.21.6
facial-emotion-recognition   0.3.4
keras                        2.11.0
opencv-contrib-python        4.10.0.84
opencv-python                4.10.0.84
pandas                       1.3.5
Pillow                       9.5.0
pip                          20.1.1
tensorflow                   2.11.0
Primarily, I used IDLE Python(version 3.7) as the base programming language, since it is typically used for machine learning and computer vision-related activities.
